                            uncovers her own powers and the dark forces at play.</p>
                        <p><strong>Review:</strong> Clockwork Angel is an intriguing blend of fantasy and steampunk.
                            Clare's characters are engaging, and the plot is filled with twists and turns. However, it
                            can feel derivative at times, and the pacing is uneven. It's a solid start to The Infernal
                            Devices series.</p>
